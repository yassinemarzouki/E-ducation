🎓 EDucation - A Revolution in Digital Learning

Welcome to EDucation, an innovative platform designed to enhance the learning experience through the latest web technologies. This project, built with Angular, aims to provide an interactive and seamless interface for students and teachers.

🔹 Modern Technology: Developed with Angular 19.1.6 for optimal performance.
🔹 Intuitive Experience: Ergonomic design and smooth animations for easy navigation.
🔹 Customization: Tailored to users' needs with advanced features.

🚀 Start the Development Server

To launch a local development server, run:

ng serve

Once the server is running, open your browser and go to http://localhost:4200/. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any source files.

🛠 Generating Components

Angular CLI provides powerful tools for generating code. To create a new component, run:

ng generate component component-name

To get a complete list of available schematics (such as components, directives, or pipes), use:

ng generate --help

📦 Building the Project

To compile the project, use:

ng build

This will generate the build files in the dist/ directory. By default, the production build optimizes the application for better performance.

🧪 Running Unit Tests

To execute unit tests with Karma, use the following command:

ng test

🔍 End-to-End (E2E) Testing

To run end-to-end tests, use:

ng e2e

Note: Angular CLI does not include an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that best suits your needs.
